            IKEv2 Optional SA&TS Payloads in Child Exchange
             draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-sa-ts-payloads-opt-03

Abstract

   This document describes a method for reducing the size of the
   Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges
   used for rekeying of the IKE or Child SA by replacing the SA and TS
   payloads with a Notify Message payload.  Reducing size and complexity
   of IKEv2 exchanges is especially useful for low power consumption
   battery powered devices.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] is
   used to negotiate Security Association (SA) parameters for the IKE SA
   and the Child SAs.  Cryptographic key material for these SAs have a
   limited lifetime before it needs to be refreshed, a process referred
   to as "rekeying".  IKEv2 uses the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange to rekey
   either the IKE SA or the Child SAs.

Internet-Draft     IKEv2 Optional Child SA&TS Payloads         July 2024


   When rekeying, a full set of negotiation parameters are exchanged.
   However, most of these parameters will be the same as before, and
   some of these parameters MUST NOT change.

   For example, the Traffic Selector (TS) negotiated for the new Child
   SA MUST cover the Traffic Selectors negotiated for the old Child SA.
   And in practically all cases, a new Child SA does not need to cover a
   wider set of Traffic.  In the rare case where this would be needed,
   either a standard rekey could be used or a new Child SA could be
   negotiated followed by a deletion of the replaced Child SA.

   Similarly, IKEv2 states that the cryptographic parameters negotiated
   for rekeying SHOULD NOT be different.  This means that the security
   properties of the IKE or Child SA in practise do not change during a
   typical rekey.

   This document specifies a method to omit these parameters and replace
   them with a single Notify Message declaring that all these parameters
   are identical to the originally negotiated parameters.

   Large scale IKEv2 gateways such as Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG)
   in 4G networks or Centralized Radio Access Network (cRAN/Cloud)
   gateways in 5G networks typically support more than 100,000 IKE/IPsec
   connections.  At any point in time, there will be hundreds or
   thousands of IKE SAs and Child SAs that are being rekeyed.  This
   takes a large amount of bandwidth and CPU power and any protocol
   simplification or bandwidth reducing would result in a significant
   resource saving.

   For Internet of Things (IoT) devices which utilize low power
   consumption technology, reducing the size of the CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchange for rekeying reduces its power consumption, as sending bytes
   over the air is usually the most power consuming operation of such a
   device.  Reducing the CPU operations required to verify the rekey
   exchanges parameters will also save power and extend the lifetime for
   these devices.

   When using identical parameters for the IKE SA or Child SA rekey, the
   SA and TS payloads can be omitted thanks to the optimization defined
   in this document.  For an IKE SA rekey, instead of the (large) SA
   payload, only a Key Exchange (KE) payload and a new Notify Type
   payload with the new SPI are required.  For a Child SA payload,
   instead of the SA or TS payloads, only an optional KE payload (when
   using PFS) and a new Notify Type payload with the new SPI are needed.
   This makes the rekey exchange packets much smaller and the peers do
   not need to verify that the SA or TS parameters are compatible with
   the old SA parameters.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiation of Support for OPTIMIZED REKEY

   To indicate support for the optimized rekey negotiation, the
   initiator includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notify payload in
   the IKE_AUTH exchange request.  If multiple IKE_AUTH exchanges are
   sent, the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notify payload should be in the
   last IKE_AUTH exchange.  During this initial key request, the entire
   SA and TS payloads are included as normal.  Note that the notify
   indicates support for optimized rekey for both IKE and Child SAs.

   A responder that does not support the optimized rekey exchange
   processes the SA and TS payloads as normal, and does not include the
   new Notify.  As per regular IKEv2 processing, a responder that does
   not recognize this new Notify, MUST ignore the notify.  Responders
   may have been administratively configured with the optimization
   turned off for local reasons.  The absense of the Notify indicates to
   the initiator that the optimization is not available, and normal,
   full rekey should be done.

   When a peer wishes to rekey an IKE SA or Child SA, it MAY use the
   optimized rekey method during the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.  If both
   peers have exchanged OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notifies, peers SHOULD
   use the optimized rekey method for rekeys.  Non-optimized, regular
   rekey requests MUST always be accepted.

   The IKE_AUTH message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
       [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
       N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED)} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                       SAr2, TSi, TSr,
                                       N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED)}

4.  Optimized Rekey of the IKE SA

   The initiator of an optimized rekey request sends a CREATE_CHILD_SA
   request with the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify payload containing the new
   Security Parameter Index (SPI) for the new IKE SA.  It omits the SA
   payload.

   The responder of an optimized rekey request replies with an included
   OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify with its new IKE SPI and also omits the SA
   payload.

   Both parties send their nonce and KE payloads just as they would do
   for a regular IKE SA rekey.

   Using the old SPI from the IKE header and the two new SPIs
   respectively from the initiator and responder's OPTIMIZED_REKEY
   payloads, both parties can perform the IKE SA rekey operation.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIi),
            Ni, KEi} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIr),
                                            Nr, KEr}

5.  Optimized Rekey of Child SAs

   The initiator of an optimized rekey request sends a CREATE_CHILD_SA
   request with the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify payload containing the new
   Security Parameter Index (SPI) for the new Child SA.  It omits the SA
   and TS payloads.  If the current Child SA was negotiated with Perfect
   Forward Secrecy (PFS), a KEi payload is included as well.  If no PFS
   was negotiated for the current Child SA, a KEi payload is not
   included.

   The responder of an optimized rekey request performs the same
   process.  It includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify with its new SPI for
   the new Child SA and omits the SA and TS payloads.  Depending on the
   PFS negotiation of the current Child SA, the responder includes a KEr
   payload.

   Both parties send their nonce payloads just as they would do for a
   regular Child SA rekey.

   Using the old SPI from the REKEY_SA payload and the two new SPIs
   respectively from the initiator and responder's OPTIMIZED_REKEY
   payloads, both parties can perform the Child SA rekey operation.

   Notify payloads that can affect the Child SA properties, such as
   USE_TRANSPORT_MODE or ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED MAY be sent but
   MUST be ignored and MUST NOT cause the Child SA properties to change.
   IPCOMP_SUPPORTED MUST be sent as it contains the required updated CPI
   parameter.

   For the Child SA that was negotiated as part of an initial IKE
   exchange (eg IKE_AUTH), its rekey parameters for the KE payload
   SHOULD be the same KE group(s) for Child SA PFS as the negotiated IKE
   SA.  If rekeying without PFS is required, the peer first initiates a
   regular Child SA rekey without KE payload, and subsequently it can
   use the optimized rekey method.  If a peer responding to an optimized
   rekey receives a request with a non-allowed PFS proposal, it MUST
   return an INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD response.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(REKEY_SA,oldSPI), N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIi),
            Ni, [KEi,]} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIr),
                                            Nr, [KEr,]}

   *  Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0.

   *  SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0.  The "Security Parameter Index
      (SPI)" field is not used in this Notify, and the new SPI is placed
      in the "Notification Data" field.

   *  Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be set to the value TBD2.

   The 'New SPI' field is the data associated with this Notify, and it's
   either a four-octet SPI when rekeying an IKE SA or an eight-octet SPI
   when rekeying a Child SA.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new Notify Message Types in the "IKEv2
   Notify Message Types - Status Types" registry.  IANA is requested to
   assign codepoints in this registry.

8.  Operational Considerations

   Some implementations allow sending rekey messages with a different
   set of Traffic Selectors or cryptographic parameters in response to a
   configuration update.  IKEv2 [RFC7296] states this SHOULD NOT be
   done.  Whether or not optimized rekeying is used, a configuration
   change that changes the Traffic Selectors or cryptographic parameters
   MUST NOT use the optimized rekey method.  It SHOULD also not use a
   regular rekey method but instead start an entire new IKE and Child SA
   negotiation with the new parameters.

9.  Security Considerations

   The optimized rekey removes sending unnecessary new parameters that
   originally would have to be validated against the original
   parameters.  In that sense, this optimization enhances the security
   of the rekey process by reducing the complexity and code required.
