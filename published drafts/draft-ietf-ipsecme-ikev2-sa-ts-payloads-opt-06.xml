<t>This document describes a method for reducing the size of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges used for rekeying of the IKE or Child SA by replacing the SA and TS payloads with a Notify Message payload.
Reducing size and complexity of IKEv2 exchanges is especially useful for low power consumption battery powered devices.</t>

      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"/> is used to negotiate Security Association (SA) parameters for the IKE SA and the Child SAs. Cryptographic key material for these SAs have a limited lifetime before it needs to be refreshed, a process referred to as "rekeying". IKEv2 uses the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange to rekey either the IKE SA or the Child SAs.</t>
      <t>When rekeying, a full set of negotiation parameters are exchanged. However, most of these parameters will be the same as before. This means that the security properties of the IKE or Child SA in practice do not change during a typical rekey.</t>
      <t>For example, the Traffic Selectors (TS) negotiated for the new Child SA must cover the Traffic Selectors negotiated for the old Child SA. And in practically all cases, a new Child SA does not need to cover a wider set of traffic. In the rare case where this would be needed, either a standard rekey could be used or a new Child SA could be negotiated followed by a deletion of the replaced Child SA. Further, per RFC 7296, the Traffic Selectors and algorithms should not change when rekeying the Child SA.</t>
      <t>This document specifies a method to omit these parameters and replace them with a single Notify Message declaring that all these parameters are identical to the originally negotiated parameters.</t>
      <t>Large scale IKEv2 gateways such as Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG) in 4G networks or Centralized Radio Access Network (cRAN/Cloud) gateways in 5G networks typically support more than 100,000 IKE/IPsec connections. At any point in time, there will be hundreds or thousands of IKE SAs and Child SAs that are being rekeyed. This takes a large amount of bandwidth and CPU power and any protocol simplification or bandwidth reducing would result in a significant resource saving.</t>
      <t>For Internet of Things (IoT) devices which utilize low power consumption technology, reducing the size of the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange for rekeying reduces its power consumption, as sending bytes over the air is usually the most power consuming operation of such a device. Reducing the CPU operations required to verify the rekey exchanges parameters will also save power and extend the lifetime for these devices.</t>
      <t>When using identical parameters for the IKE SA or Child SA rekey, the SA and TS payloads can be omitted thanks to the optimization defined in this document. For an IKE SA rekey, instead of the (large) SA payload, only a Key Exchange (KE) payload, a Nonce payload, and a new Notify Type payload with the new Security Parameter Index (SPI) are required. For a Child SA rekey, instead of the SA or TS payloads, only an optional KE payload (when using PFS), a Nonce payload, and a new Notify Type payload with the new SPI are needed. This makes the rekey exchange packets much smaller and the peers do not need to verify that the SA or TS parameters are compatible with the old SA parameters.</t>

      <name>Negotiation of Support for Optimized Rekey</name>
      <t>To indicate support for the optimized rekey negotiation, the initiator includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notify payload in the IKE_AUTH exchange request.
If the responder supports this optimized rekey and is configured to use it, then it includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED in the IKE_AUTH response message.
If multiple IKE_AUTH exchanges are sent, the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notify payload should be in the first IKE_AUTH request and the last IKE_AUTH response.
During the IKE_AUTH exchanges, the entire SA and TS payloads are included as normal. Note that the notify indicates support for optimized rekey for both IKE and Child SAs.</t>
      <t>A responder that does not support the optimized rekey exchange processes the SA and TS payloads as normal, and does not include the new Notify. As per regular IKEv2 processing, a responder that does not recognize this new Notify, will ignore it. Responders may have been administratively configured with the optimization turned off for local reasons. The absence of the Notify indicates to the initiator that the optimization is not available, and regular rekey should be used.</t>
      <t>The IKE_AUTH message exchange in this case is shown below:</t>

Non-optimized, regular rekey requests <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> always be accepted.
The regular rekey can be retried when the optimized rekey fails.</t>
      <t>Note that, except for the key and identification information such as the SPI, the optimized rekey <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> inherit all other properties of the SA being rekeyed.
This means the configurations related to the SA being rekeyed are supposed to have no changes.
If there is a change to the configurations, the regular rekey <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used instead.
After the regular rekey, the next rekey can use the optimized way if there is no change to the configuration.</t>

It omits the SA and TS payloads.
If the Child SA being rekeyed was negotiated with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), a KEi payload is included as well.
If no PFS was negotiated for the Child SA being rekeyed, a KEi payload is not included.
If the Child SA being rekeyed was created with IP compression, then IPCOMP_SUPPORTED notifications <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be sent as they contain the required updated Compression Parameter Indexes (CPIs).</t>
      <t>The responder of an optimized rekey request performs the same process. It includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify with its new SPI for the new Child SA and omits the SA and TS payloads.

In contrast, the Post-quantum Preshared Keys (PPKs) defined in <xref target="RFC9867"/> can be considered as part of the key information since they are used in the session keys calculations, therefore, the PPKs negotiation <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be included in the optimized Child SA rekey if <xref target="RFC9867"/> are used.</t>

      <t>If a responder fails to process the optimized rekey request because for some reasons it cannot re-use SA parameters for the SA being rekeyed (e.g., there is a change in the responder's configuration), it <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> return an error as the notification of type NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.

        <t>For the initial Child SA that was negotiated as part of an initial IKE exchange (e.g., IKE_AUTH), at the time of its creation the parameters of PFS and KE method(s) for Child SAs are not negotiated.
However, <xref target="I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info"/> provides a mechanism to negotiate these parameters during the creation of the initial Child SA.</t>
        <t>If both peers support and use <xref target="I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info"/>, the PFS policy and KE method(s) for the initial Child SA is known during its creation.

If <xref target="I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info"/> is not supported or used, a regular rekey <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be used for the first time to negotiate these parameters. Then, the next rekey can use the optimized way.</t>

      <t>Some implementations allow sending rekey messages with a different set of Traffic Selectors or cryptographic parameters in response to a configuration update. IKEv2 <xref target="RFC7296"/> states this "<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>" be done. But if there is a configuration change that changes the Traffic Selectors, cryptographic parameters, or other properties of the SA, the regular rekey should be used to make the configuration change active, since the optimized rekey can't express such changes.</t>
      <t>Two peers <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> have the same PFS policy and contain mutally acceptable KE method(s), otherwise, the rekey (regardless of regular or optimized way) of the initial Child SA created in the IKE_AUTH exchange would fail. This issue is also discussed in detail in <xref target="I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info"/>.</t>

      <t>The optimized rekey removes sending unnecessary new parameters that originally would have to be validated against the original parameters. In that sense, this optimization enhances the security of the rekey process by reducing the complexity and code required.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t>The Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol has a certain computational and communication overhead with respect to the number of round trips required and the cryptographic operations involved. In remote access situations, the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) is used for authentication, which adds several more round trips and consequently latency.</t>
              <t>To re-establish security associations (SAs) upon a failure recovery condition is time consuming especially when an IPsec peer (such as a VPN gateway) needs to re-establish a large number of SAs with various endpoints. A high number of concurrent sessions might cause additional problems for an IPsec peer during SA re-establishment.</t>
              <t>In order to avoid the need to re-run the key exchange protocol from scratch, it would be useful to provide an efficient way to resume an IKE/IPsec session. This document proposes an extension to IKEv2 that allows a client to re-establish an IKE SA with a gateway in a highly efficient manner, utilizing a previously established IKE SA.</t>
              <t>A client can reconnect to a gateway from which it was disconnected. The proposed approach encodes partial IKE state into an opaque ticket, which can be stored on the client or in a centralized store, and is later made available to the IKEv2 responder for re-authentication. We use the term ticket to refer to the opaque data that is created by the IKEv2 responder. This document does not specify the format of the ticket but examples are provided. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

              <t>This document describes how to extend the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) to allow multiple key exchanges to take place while computing a shared secret during a Security Association (SA) setup.</t>
              <t>This document utilizes the IKE_INTERMEDIATE exchange, where multiple key exchanges are performed when an IKE SA is being established. It also introduces a new IKEv2 exchange, IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE, which is used for the same purpose when the IKE SA is being rekeyed or is creating additional Child SAs.</t>
              <t>This document updates RFC 7296 by renaming a Transform Type 4 from "Diffie-Hellman Group (D-H)" to "Key Exchange Method (KE)" and renaming a field in the Key Exchange Payload from "Diffie-Hellman Group Num" to "Key Exchange Method". It also renames an IANA registry for this Transform Type from "Transform Type 4 - Diffie- Hellman Group Transform IDs" to "Transform Type 4 - Key Exchange Method Transform IDs". These changes generalize key exchange algorithms that can be used in IKEv2.</t>

            <title>Mixing Preshared Keys in the IKE_INTERMEDIATE and CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchanges of the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) for Post-Quantum Security</title>
            <author fullname="V. Smyslov" initials="V." surname="Smyslov"/>
            <date month="November" year="2025"/>
            <abstract>
              <t>An Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) extension defined in RFC 8784 allows IPsec traffic to be protected against someone storing VPN communications and decrypting them later, when (and if) a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) is available. The protection is achieved by means of a Post-quantum Preshared Key (PPK) that is mixed into the session keys calculation. However, this protection does not cover an initial IKEv2 Security Association (SA), which might be unacceptable in some scenarios. This specification defines an alternative way to provide protection against quantum computers, which is similar to the solution defined in RFC 8784, but it also protects the initial IKEv2 SA.</t>
              <t>RFC 8784 assumes that PPKs are static and thus they are only used when an initial IKEv2 SA is created. If a fresh PPK is available before the IKE SA expires, then the only way to use it is to delete the current IKE SA and create a new one from scratch, which is inefficient. This specification defines a way to use PPKs in active IKEv2 SAs for creating additional IPsec SAs and rekey operations.</t>

This new payload type can be used for various purposes, such as decreasing encapsulation overhead for small IP packets; however, the focus in this document is to enhance IP Traffic Flow Security (IP-TFS) by adding Traffic Flow Confidentiality (TFC) to encrypted IP-encapsulated traffic. TFC is provided by obscuring the size and frequency of IP traffic using a fixed-size, constant-send-rate IPsec tunnel. The solution allows for congestion control, as well as nonconstant send-rate usage.</t>
