Optimized Rekeys in the Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2)
             draft-ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-sa-ts-payloads-opt-05

Abstract

   This document describes a method for reducing the size of the
   Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges
   used for rekeying of the IKE or Child SA by replacing the SA and TS
   payloads with a Notify Message payload.  Reducing size and complexity
   of IKEv2 exchanges is especially useful for low power consumption
   battery powered devices.

1.  Introduction

   The Internet Key Exchange protocol version 2 (IKEv2) [RFC7296] is
   used to negotiate Security Association (SA) parameters for the IKE SA
   and the Child SAs.  Cryptographic key material for these SAs have a
   limited lifetime before it needs to be refreshed, a process referred
   to as "rekeying".  IKEv2 uses the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange to rekey
   either the IKE SA or the Child SAs.

   When rekeying, a full set of negotiation parameters are exchanged.
   However, most of these parameters will be the same as before.  This
   means that the security properties of the IKE or Child SA in practice
   do not change during a typical rekey.

   For example, the Traffic Selectors (TS) negotiated for the new Child
   SA must cover the Traffic Selectors negotiated for the old Child SA.
   And in practically all cases, a new Child SA does not need to cover a
   wider set of traffic.  In the rare case where this would be needed,
   either a standard rekey could be used or a new Child SA could be
   negotiated followed by a deletion of the replaced Child SA.  Further,
   per RFC 7296, the Traffic Selectors and algorithms should not change
   when rekeying the Child SA.

   This document specifies a method to omit these parameters and replace
   them with a single Notify Message declaring that all these parameters
   are identical to the originally negotiated parameters.

   Large scale IKEv2 gateways such as Evolved Packet Data Gateway (ePDG)
   in 4G networks or Centralized Radio Access Network (cRAN/Cloud)
   gateways in 5G networks typically support more than 100,000 IKE/IPsec
   connections.  At any point in time, there will be hundreds or
   thousands of IKE SAs and Child SAs that are being rekeyed.  This
   takes a large amount of bandwidth and CPU power and any protocol
   simplification or bandwidth reducing would result in a significant
   resource saving.

   For Internet of Things (IoT) devices which utilize low power
   consumption technology, reducing the size of the CREATE_CHILD_SA
   exchange for rekeying reduces its power consumption, as sending bytes
   over the air is usually the most power consuming operation of such a
   device.  Reducing the CPU operations required to verify the rekey
   exchanges parameters will also save power and extend the lifetime for
   these devices.

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


   When using identical parameters for the IKE SA or Child SA rekey, the
   SA and TS payloads can be omitted thanks to the optimization defined
   in this document.  For an IKE SA rekey, instead of the (large) SA
   payload, only a Key Exchange (KE) payload, a Nonce payload, and a new
   Notify Type payload with the new Security Parameter Index (SPI) are
   required.  For a Child SA rekey, instead of the SA or TS payloads,
   only an optional KE payload (when using PFS), a Nonce payload, and a
   new Notify Type payload with the new SPI are needed.  This makes the
   rekey exchange packets much smaller and the peers do not need to
   verify that the SA or TS parameters are compatible with the old SA
   parameters.

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Negotiation of Support for Optimized Rekey

   To indicate support for the optimized rekey negotiation, the
   initiator includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notify payload in
   the IKE_AUTH exchange request.  If the responder supports this
   optimized rekey and is configured to use it, then it includes the
   OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED in the IKE_AUTH response message.  If
   multiple IKE_AUTH exchanges are sent, the OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED
   notify payload should be in the first IKE_AUTH request and the last
   IKE_AUTH response.  During the IKE_AUTH exchanges, the entire SA and
   TS payloads are included as normal.  Note that the notify indicates
   support for optimized rekey for both IKE and Child SAs.

   A responder that does not support the optimized rekey exchange
   processes the SA and TS payloads as normal, and does not include the
   new Notify.  As per regular IKEv2 processing, a responder that does
   not recognize this new Notify, will ignore it.  Responders may have
   been administratively configured with the optimization turned off for
   local reasons.  The absence of the Notify indicates to the initiator
   that the optimization is not available, and regular rekey should be
   used.

   The IKE_AUTH message exchange in this case is shown below:

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,]
       [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr,
       N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED)} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                       SAr2, TSi, TSr,
                                       N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED)}

   If both peers have exchanged OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED notifies,
   peers SHOULD use the optimized rekey method for rekeys.  Non-
   optimized, regular rekey requests MUST always be accepted.  The
   regular rekey can be retried when the optimized rekey fails.

   Note that, except for the key and identification information such as
   the SPI, the optimized rekey MUST inherit all other properties of the
   SA being rekeyed.  This means the configurations related to the SA
   being rekeyed are supposed to have no changes.  If there is a change
   to the configurations, the regular rekey MUST be used instead.  After
   the regular rekey, the next rekey can use the optimized way if there
   is no change to the configuration.

4.  Optimized Rekey of IKE SA

   The initiator of an optimized rekey request sends a CREATE_CHILD_SA
   request with the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify payload containing the new
   SPI for the new IKE SA.  It omits the SA payload.

   The responder of an optimized rekey request replies with an included
   OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify with its new IKE SPI and also omits the SA
   payload.

   Both parties send their nonce and KE payloads just as they would do
   for a regular IKE SA rekey.

   Using the old SPI from the IKE header and the two new SPIs
   respectively from the initiator and responder's OPTIMIZED_REKEY
   payloads, both parties can perform the IKE SA rekey operation.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIi),
            Ni, KEi} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIr),
                                            Nr, KEr}

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


5.  Optimized Rekey of Child SAs

   The initiator of an optimized rekey request sends a CREATE_CHILD_SA
   request with the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify payload containing the new
   SPI for the new Child SA.  It omits the SA and TS payloads.  If the
   Child SA being rekeyed was negotiated with Perfect Forward Secrecy
   (PFS), a KEi payload is included as well.  If no PFS was negotiated
   for the Child SA being rekeyed, a KEi payload is not included.  If
   the Child SA being rekeyed was created with IP compression, then
   IPCOMP_SUPPORTED notifications MUST be sent as they contain the
   required updated Compression Parameter Indexes (CPIs).

   The responder of an optimized rekey request performs the same
   process.  It includes the OPTIMIZED_REKEY notify with its new SPI for
   the new Child SA and omits the SA and TS payloads.  Depending on the
   PFS and IP compression negotiation of the Child SA being rekeyed, the
   responder correspondingly includes a KEr payload and/or the
   IPCOMP_SUPPORTED Notify payload.

   Both parties send their nonce payloads just as they would do for a
   regular Child SA rekey.

   Using the old SPI from the REKEY_SA payload and the two new SPIs
   respectively from the initiator and responder's OPTIMIZED_REKEY
   payloads, both parties can perform the Child SA rekey operation.

   Except for the key and identification information such as the SPI and
   CPI, all other properties of the Child SA being rekeyed MUST be
   inherited to the one newly created by the optimized rekey.  Notify
   payloads that can affect these properties, such as
   USE_TRANSPORT_MODE, ESP_TFC_PADDING_NOT_SUPPORTED, ROHC_SUPPORTED
   [RFC5857] or USE_AGGFRAG [RFC9347] MUST NOT be sent.  In contrast,
   the Post-quantum Preshared Keys (PPKs) defined in
   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-qr-alt] can be considered as part of the key
   information since they are used in the session keys calculations,
   therefore, the PPKs negotiation MUST be included in the optimized
   Child SA rekey if [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-qr-alt] are used.

   The CREATE_CHILD_SA message exchange in this case is shown below:

   Initiator                       Responder
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   HDR, SK {N(REKEY_SA,oldSPI), N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIi),
            Ni, [KEi,]} -->
                               <-- HDR, SK {N(OPTIMIZED_REKEY,newSPIr),
                                            Nr, [KEr,]}

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


   If a responder fails to process the optimized rekey request because
   for some reasons it cannot re-use SA parameters for the SA being
   rekeyed (e.g., there is a change in the responder's configuration),
   it MUST return an error as the notification of type
   NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN.  After receiving the error response of the
   optimized rekey, the initiator can retry a regular rekey.

5.1.  Optimized Rekey of the Initial Child SA

   For the initial Child SA that was negotiated as part of an initial
   IKE exchange (e.g., IKE_AUTH), at the time of its creation the
   parameters of PFS and KE method(s) for Child SAs are not negotiated.
   However, [I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info] provides a mechanism
   to negotiate these parameters during the creation of the initial
   Child SA.

   If both peers support and use [I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info],
   the PFS policy and KE method(s) for the initial Child SA is known
   during its creation.  Therefore, in this situation, when rekeying the
   initial Child SA for the first time, the optimized way SHOULD be
   used.  If [I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info] is not supported or
   used, a regular rekey MUST be used for the first time to negotiate
   these parameters.  Then, the next rekey can use the optimized way.

6.  Payload Formats

6.1.  OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED Notify

   The OPTIMIZED_REKEY_SUPPORTED Notify Message type notification is
   used by the initiator and responder to indicate their support for the
   optimized rekey negotiation.

                        1                   2                   3

   *  Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0.

   *  SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0, meaning no SPI is present.

   *  Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be set to the value TBD1.

   This Notify Message type contains no data.

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


6.2.  OPTIMIZED_REKEY Notify

   The OPTIMIZED_REKEY Notify Message type is used to perform an
   optimized IKE SA or Child SA rekey.

    0                 1                   2                   3

   |                                                               |
   ~                            New SPI                            ~
   |                                                               |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------+

   *  Protocol ID (1 octet) - MUST be 0.

   *  SPI Size (1 octet) - MUST be 0.  The "Security Parameter Index
      (SPI)" field is not used in this Notify, and the new SPI is placed
      in the "Notification Data" field.

   *  Notify Message Type (2 octets) - MUST be set to the value TBD2.

   The Notification Data for this notify contains new SPI.  Its size
   depends on the type of SA being rekeyed.  In case of IKE SA it MUST
   be 8 octets.  In case of Child SA it MUST be equal to the SPI Size
   field in the REKEY_SA notification that identifies the SA being
   rekeyed.

7.  Interaction with IKEv2 Extensions

7.1.  Multiple Key Exchanges

   [RFC9370] defines the use of multiple key exchange methods for the
   purpose of IKE SA and Child SA establishment in IKEv2.  If multiple
   key exchange methods are used for an SA, then optimized rekey of this
   SA MUST use the same key exchange methods.  It means that the
   CREATE_CHILD_SA will be followed by some IKE_FOLLOWUP_KE exchanges
   and the number of these exchanges will be determined by the number of
   additional key exchange methods used for the SA being rekeyed.

7.2.  IKE Session Resumption

   IKE Session Resumption [RFC5723] defines an IKEv2 extension, that
   allows peers to quickly restore IKE SA when it is for some reason
   deleted.  When used with optimized rekey, the following rules apply.



Kampati, et al.          Expires 8 January 2026                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


   *  Support for optimized rekeys MUST be re-negotiated during the
      resumption (in the IKE_AUTH exchange).

   *  If support for optimized rekey is negotiated during resumption,
      then all IKE SA algorithms, including key exchange methods, are
      taken from the resumption ticket (i.e., from the SA being
      resumed), since they are not negotiated in the IKE_SA_RESUME
      exchange.

   *  The initial Child SA created during the resumption is considered
      as been created with key exchange methods for the IKE SA, that
      were stored in the resumption ticket.  This is despite the fact,
      that during the resumption no key exchanges (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)
      take place, the session keys are derived from the keys stored in
      the resumption ticket.

7.3.  Mixing Preshared Keys in the CREATE_CHILD_SA Exchanges

   [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-qr-alt] defines how PPKs can be mixed into
   the session keys calculations.  In particular, this document allows
   PPKs to be used in the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchanges when SAs are being
   rekeyed.  If peers support [I-D.ietf-ipsecme-ikev2-qr-alt] and a PPK
   was used for the SA being rekeyed, then they MUST NOT silently re-use
   this PPK in case of optimized rekey and MUST re-negotiate the use of
   PPKs in the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines two new Notify Message Types in the "IKEv2
   Notify Message Types - Status Types" registry.  IANA is requested to
   assign codepoints in this registry.

9.  Operational Considerations

   Some implementations allow sending rekey messages with a different
   set of Traffic Selectors or cryptographic parameters in response to a
   configuration update.  IKEv2 [RFC7296] states this "SHOULD NOT" be
   done.  But if there is a configuration change that changes the
   Traffic Selectors, cryptographic parameters, or other properties of
   the SA, the regular rekey should be used to make the configuration
   change active, since the optimized rekey can't express such changes.

Internet-Draft     Optimized Rekey of IKE & Child SAs          July 2025


   Two peers MUST have the same PFS policy and contain mutally
   acceptable KE method(s), otherwise, the rekey (regardless of regular
   or optimized way) of the initial Child SA created in the IKE_AUTH
   exchange would fail.  This issue is also discussed in detail in
   [I-D.pwouters-ipsecme-child-pfs-info].

10.  Security Considerations

   The optimized rekey removes sending unnecessary new parameters that
   originally would have to be validated against the original
   parameters.  In that sense, this optimization enhances the security
   of the rekey process by reducing the complexity and code required.
